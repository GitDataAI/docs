# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Running the development server
To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.


> cd docs  
> npm run start

By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000.

Congratulations!
